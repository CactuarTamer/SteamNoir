# SteamNoir
The SKD Game Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for the game project! 

I'll assume if you're reading this you're one of us. We'll use this to develop the game.
It's not just for programmers! Artists and writers will also add/track files through the repository.
If you don't have experince wth git, that's okay. It's easy to learn the basics. 

..I'll remove stuff from this readme as it's no longer necessary since this is a public repository and we look like a bunch of dorks right now probably. 
An accurate impression, of course but we don't want to go around advertising it.

## Basic Procedures
With multiple people working on the same project it'll be important to keep things organized.
When you work on a new thing, make an issue for it, make a branch for that issue, and save/commit your changes on that branch.

When you finish with a branch, we will merge it back into the master branch,
but merging can break things, so the person who made the changes should not be the person to merge. 
Have your thing looked over by one of the other members, and have them merge it,
or let you know about any problems or questions they find in the issue.



## Naming convention for issues, branches, and commits. 

Explain later


## File Structure

It's super not going to work if people just make random folders but we can talk about this later, whatever.

## More stuff later

Probably.
